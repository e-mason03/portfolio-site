                <p>“What the Englishman said about survival was this: ‘If you stop taking pride in your appearance, you will very soon die.’ 
                  He said that he had seen several men die in the following way: ‘They ceased to stand up straight, then ceased to shave or wash, 
                  then ceased to get out of bed, then ceased to talk, then died. There is much to be said for it: it is evidently a very easy and 
                  painless way to go.’”</p>
