          <p>
            Ethan Mason took an interest in the art some call "programming" at
            an early age. Beginning with the simple magics of block-based
            programming, he developed his foundation in elementary school. Later
            on, Ethan continued his journey in middle school, where he became
            familiar with Python, HTML, and CSS, though he was only scratching
            the surface. The point where Ethan really fell in love with the
            secret languages of programming was in high school, where he learned
            Java and reinforced his Python skills. Here, his abilities took
            their first big step, and Ethan was able to wield his skills in a
            more sophisticated manner.
          </p>

          <p>
            After graduating from high school, Ethan took his talents to the
            University of Texas, reknowned for its impressive pedigree in
            computer science. Here, he polished his programming skills in Java,
            Python, and C. The turning point for Ethan at this stage was that he
            realized there was still more hidden magic beneath the surface.
            Courses such as Data Structures and Computer Architecture revealed
            that the power of programming derived from various complicated
            instruments within the computers he'd been using. He was shocked to
            learn that so much eloquence had been right under his nose the whole
            time.
          </p>

          <p>
            As he obtained more knowledge and experience, Ethan was fortunate
            enough to receive an offer to work as a software engineering intern
            at a startup company. Now as an intern, this opportunity allows him
            to apply his skills in a real-world setting for the first time. Not
            without its challenges, the experience has been an excellent source
            of more knowledge, where he has been able to unlock even more
            languages such as React and Typscript.
